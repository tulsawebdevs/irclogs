[01:01:01] <percent20> Just dove deeeeeeeep into django framework. Instead of me swimming my head is. heh.
[09:54:38] <esdev> !weather tulsa
[10:47:45] <groovecoder> w00t! I'm un-banned from the Tulsa Health Department website! I really need to figure out how they're determining their ban list
[10:52:40] <ZiggyTheHamster> well one thing I noticed is that the app is outsourced to I guess Georgia
[10:53:09] <esdev> probably Georgia, Ukraine. :P
[10:53:42] <ZiggyTheHamster> it looks like some company made one state's health department app and then resold that app to other states
[10:53:55] <ZiggyTheHamster> so obviously they have a vested interest in keeping the data inside it only
[10:54:28] <ZiggyTheHamster> other states/localities I guess I should say
[10:55:58] <esdev> that's typical, though. many dev companies will target a sector/industry, build an app, then resell it to others in the same line of biz. i know casino mobile app dev cos that do
[10:56:14] <esdev> well, look at DineInsight. same thing
[10:57:19] <groovecoder> ZiggyTheHamster: oh for sure. they put gegov.com iframe in their own site, and when I went around to other cities' health department sites, a couple others' content was banned/blocked for me too. so I'm sure gegov.com is/was banning me
[10:58:27] <groovecoder> just looked up DineInsight. I love that press releases always say "___, a leading provider of ____ just did ____"
[10:58:38] <esdev> cuz ur a bad, bad netizen. boo@u. ;)
[10:59:08] <esdev> sshhh. speak not of that-which-can't-be-named
[10:59:11] <groovecoder> we should write an app that automagically squashes press releases down into tweets
[10:59:12] <ZiggyTheHamster> well I bet that gegov.com isn't going to want you to scrape them because they make money off you not being able to
[10:59:34] <ZiggyTheHamster> also press release writing must be a shitty job
[10:59:37] <esdev> izza fact
[11:00:06] <groovecoder> ZiggyTheHamster: for sure. I'm trying to throttle my requests, but I think I have a bug in my paging code so it might actually be firing off hundreds of requests in the space of a few seconds ><
[11:00:23] <esdev> eek
[11:00:33] <groovecoder> er, 80 requests (4000/50)
[11:00:55] <ZiggyTheHamster> yeah, that's probably why
[11:01:06] <ZiggyTheHamster> some dumbass netadmin sees that and goes OMG IT'S AN ATTACK
[11:01:22] <groovecoder> I'm sure it's an automated block
[11:01:26] <groovecoder> yeah
[11:01:39] <groovecoder> AN ATTACK ON OUR SHITTY BUSINESS MODEL! :)
[11:01:55] <esdev> dumbass netadmin? isn't that redundant?
[11:01:56] <groovecoder> anyone have experience with google custom search?
[11:02:22] <esdev> groovecoder: sorry, no.
[11:02:35] <groovecoder> esdev: no! there are lots of awesome, under-appreciated netadmins out there. they're the ones we never hear about because their nets Just Work™
[11:03:34] <esdev> i was being facetious. sorry. interwebz cant display sarcarsm.
[11:03:50] <esdev> or even sarcasm
[11:04:10] <groovecoder> </sarcasm>
[11:05:53] <esdev> anyone use the cPanel secure webdisk to access their site on a mac. mine just sits and spins the happy color wheel.
[11:07:33] <esdev> brb
[11:32:08] <zerokarmaleft>  1~3~4~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~5~
[11:34:05] <zerokarmaleft> i'd blame it on the cat but i don't have one
[11:42:08] <groovecoder> trolling MattGalloway ... I was looking at http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-ios-development-sinatra-cedar and realized my dislike of iOS development is pretty much summed up like so: http://screencast.com/t/wtT6sF1uN1Gf (point-and-click programming FTL)
[11:54:04] <zerokarmaleft> didn't know about cocoapods
[11:54:45] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: there aren't even any IB screenshots in that article
[11:55:19] <chimchim237> are they anything like copepods?
[11:55:51] <zerokarmaleft> it's like bundler
[11:55:58] <zerokarmaleft> no relation to crustaceans
[11:58:16] <groovecoder> IB screenshots?
[11:58:33] <groovecoder> chimchim237!
[11:58:37] <chimchim237> ah, well then i would not be of any use.
[11:58:42] <groovecoder> you on InstantBird, or LimeChat?
[11:58:52] <chimchim237> groovecode: i'm here huckleberry
[11:58:58] <chimchim237> instantbird
[12:02:06] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: interface builder
[14:34:14] <percent20> is anyone able to right click on this image? http://ow.ly/i/sFOx/original
[14:34:57] <groovecoder> percent20: yes, when I disable javascript :)
[14:35:39] <percent20> yeah. that is what I thought. I always download an image if i can't rightclick on it whether I want it or not.
[14:35:53] <percent20> I now own that picture. :D
[14:36:05] <groovecoder> I'm going to click the little "Report Abuse" link and report that they're abusing the web
[14:36:53] <percent20> lol.
[14:37:31] <percent20> why do companies do that even? i mean it is stupid.
[14:40:05] <percent20> hrm... I am thinking about scraping all their images.
[14:45:47] <danf1> What's amazing is that all you have to do (with Chrome on Max OS X, anyway) is drag the image to a Finder window, and wham-o, you have it stored locally. Stupid.
[14:46:17] <percent20> same with firefox.
[15:00:56] <percent20> :D I am now nabbing all their pictures 1 at a time.
[15:05:34] <MattGalloway> groovecoder: I get your whole code vs. visual programming thing. It's sort of like our ongoing .NET conversation as of late. The problem isn't so much a visual development environment, it's developers that never learn to work beyond the limitations of visual development environments when it's warranted.
[15:06:34] <MattGalloway> groovecoder: The reality is that for certain types of work, a good visual dev environment can make you much more efficient and produce a higher quality project.
[15:07:31] <percent20> and for some environments all you have is a visual editor because its just crazy to try to do parts of it without it.
[15:07:48] <MattGalloway> groovecoder: But if you're not a conscientious (and competent) development you can product some truly aweful code with visual dev tools... the say is true, however, of non-visual dev tools as well.
[15:08:05] <MattGalloway> s/say/same/
[15:10:26] <percent20> I love when geeks discount an entire technology stack because 1 person they met that wasn't a geek had a hard time using it.
[15:10:27] <MattGalloway> groovecoder: No hard feelings though. Besides, I hate all software written using vim, because everyone knows, stuff written using vim sucks.
[15:11:23] <MattGalloway> percent20 I love when geeks discount an entire technology because *they* thought it was difficult. ;)
[15:11:58] <percent20> I can understand that more than i can the "this person I know" argument.
[15:12:33] <percent20> I find java a huge pain in the ass and I haven't even gotten to code in it much so i disregard it almost completely.
[15:12:55] <percent20> granted most of my issues stem from bad installs that I have to try and fix.
[15:13:53] <MattGalloway> groovecoder: You know...thinking about it, I think the problem may be that it's easier to bring lousy software to release using visual dev tools that it is from the CLI. So I guess, maybe coding from the CLI is like birth control for bad software. ;)
[15:15:17] <percent20> however if we can just get bad software devs to abstain from programming the problem is solved completely, well mostly.
[15:15:46] <percent20> will get the very stupid dev who decides to "try" and screws up.
[15:32:49] <percent20> groovecoder: I have a fun db design issue for you on friday. :)
[15:33:07] <percent20> Or really anyone who wants to participate
[15:34:17] <percent20> Destos: you around?
[15:34:40] <groovecoder> !MattGalloway++
[15:34:47] <groovecoder> oh man, we really need an irc quote pile
[15:34:55] <groovecoder> MattGalloway: "coding from the CLI is like birth control for bad software."
[15:35:28] <groovecoder> we just packed the kids up to go to grandma's for the next 3 days!
[15:35:36] <percent20> you could cobble together a plugin in a matter of an hour or less.
[15:35:55] <percent20> so no kids for a few days eh?
[15:36:06] <groovecoder> every time I'm away from the kids, I think I'm going to do some massive amount of coding on some awesome project. but all I really do is sleep more. :)
[15:36:24] <percent20> lol. You should change that this time.
[15:37:01] <percent20> ACTION inconspicuously points to developerrage
[15:37:20] <groovecoder> no way, if I code something it's going to be more THD hacking until they ban me again:)
[15:37:28] <percent20> heh
[15:38:16] <percent20> you should setup an autoscaling rackspace script
[15:39:22] <percent20> set it up where you scale to 1000 servers and hit it all at once.
[15:39:34] <percent20> see how much you can scrape before they crash.

[16:29:17] <groovecoder> Destos: you know WP_Query pretty well?
[16:29:27] <groovecoder> and/or chimchim237 ^
[16:29:41] <Destos> I've used it, not sure what "well" entails
[16:29:49] <Destos> what would you like to do
[16:30:07] <groovecoder> Destos: not me. craigcook in #webdev on irc.mozilla.org
[16:31:58] <Destos> did he post what he wanted to do?
[16:32:15] <groovecoder> not yet
[16:32:22] <groovecoder> just asked for anyone with WP_Query skills
[16:50:33] <zerokarmaleft> groovecoder: a quote plugin sounds like a good candidate for a NoSQL backend.../ahem
[16:55:33] <percent20> zerokarmaleft: I wont be in class anymore. I am droping the class. Going to spend the time reviewing it on my own and learning. Then next semester take it again.
[17:01:18] <groovecoder> zerokarmaleft: like a big json file? :)
[17:26:29] <ZiggyTheHamster> I will say, visual development tools have their place sometimes. Sometimes = Qt Designer or equivalent (Glade, etc.)
[17:26:41] <ZiggyTheHamster> I absolutely hate visual designers for web-based projects
[17:26:50] <ZiggyTheHamster> to me, your code should be simple enough to visualize what's going on
[17:27:21] <ZiggyTheHamster> I can look at a 5 line partial and tell you what style it's going to be just by how it's written semantically
[17:28:07] <ZiggyTheHamster> then again I also come from a "code is beautiful" background and I like Vim and TextMate… :P
[17:28:45] <ZiggyTheHamster> (though gvim, because traversing folders is easier with a mouse)
[17:30:51] <groovecoder> percent20: do you know of a way to make django forms NOT use, e.g., id=id_assertion, for a form field?
[17:31:24] <groovecoder> e.g., we want to show a login form in both the header and footer, so the 'assertion' field should technically be a class, not an id
[17:32:14] <percent20> groovecoder: no, sorry.
[17:32:14] <groovecoder> ZiggyTheHamster: FuzzyFinder > traversing folders with mouse
[17:34:11] <ZiggyTheHamster> well I don't use the gvim open dialog :p
[17:34:27] <ZiggyTheHamster> I use dolphin to find what I'm editing and right click, open with gvim
[17:34:59] <ZiggyTheHamster> probably could end up being a wash if I didn't have stuff in like /home/keith/Documents/My\ Projects/work\ for\ others/.....
[17:35:22] <ZiggyTheHamster> though /home/keith/Documents is a FAT32 volume I've got mounted to share between OSes
[17:35:28] <percent20> groovecoder: heh my script is still going to yank as many of those images as I can.
[18:24:34] <groovecoder> ZiggyTheHamster: what's dolphin?
[18:25:23] <ZiggyTheHamster> the KDE file manager
[18:27:17] <groovecoder> ah
[18:27:28] <groovecoder> which distro do you use?
[18:28:13] <groovecoder> not Kubuntu I hope ;)
[20:19:26] <percent20> !karma?
[20:19:41] <groovecoder> it should sort by points :)
[20:19:45] <groovecoder> I know I know
[20:19:50] <groovecoder> maybe I'll do that later tonight :)
[20:20:04] <percent20> lol I didn't even get to think that far. i was thinking about how to do it. lol.
[20:20:46] <percent20> we might actually consider moving to a nosql db. I can install mongodb
[20:46:55] <groovecoder> why install? just use mongolab :)
[21:22:26] <percent20> that is true.
[21:03:43] <percent20> !weather
[21:03:47] <percent20> :D
