[15:54:42] <mrmakeit> ?
[15:54:51] <mrmakeit> he's hurting the poor bot.
[15:55:27] <groovecoder> mrmakeit: I'd sooner kick the bots than kick jwhitlock ;)
[15:55:56] <jwhitlock> Does the !jwhitlock++ have to be at the front of the line?
[15:56:01] <jwhitlock> I guess so
[15:56:03] <mrmakeit> tulsabot_node has a loop protection but tulsabot_ is breaking.
[15:56:11] <mrmakeit> the protection

[16:09:14] <mrmakeit> the beauty that is JS variables
[16:10:08] <groovecoder> yeah, the best is typeof(NaN) == "number" // true
[16:10:19] <groovecoder> wtf?
[16:10:59] <mrmakeit> "number" = number but not A number
[16:11:25] <groovecoder> NaN is a number type that means "not a number"
